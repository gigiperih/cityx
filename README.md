## configuration
- Android Studio `4.2.1`
- Kotlin `v1.4.10`
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
- Android Architecture Component with clean arch approach
- Unit tested in all layers

## run and build
- build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- test: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- known issue: consider increase `jvm heap` size if OOM occur

## feature
- implemented using `pragmatic TDD`
- use `Trie()` data structure for faster runtime search on a large datasets (better than linear time complexity)
- automated kaban github-project can be found here: https://github.com/gigiperih/cityx/projects/1

## data format

hundreds of thousands item
```json
{
    "country": "RU",
    "name": "Novinki",
    "_id": 519188,
    "coord": {
      "lon": 37.666668,
      "lat": 55.683334
    }
  }
```

## known issue:
- Code coverage is still very low.
- Can be modularized.
- `Trie` implementation truncates some duplicates data.

## notes:
- Bad english communication skills
- Should have deep down theoritical knowledege
